"""On-demand PQL syntax reference.

Relocates the Plane Query Language reference out of every list tool's schema
(saved ~5,500 tokens per `tools/list` manifest call) and behind an on-demand
tool. The 4 PQL-enabled list tools (`list_work_items`,
`list_workspace_work_items`, `list_cycle_work_items`,
`list_module_work_items`) carry only a one-line hint
pointing to this tool; full syntax is fetched on demand.

Archived work-item listing is deliberately excluded because Plane CE v1.3.1
does not ship a PQL compiler for that public endpoint; it supports JSON filters.

Note: the error-recovery payload on a failed PQL query still inlines
`PQL_FULL_REFERENCE` so a single round-trip self-correction loop is preserved
even if the model never calls `get_pql_reference` proactively.
